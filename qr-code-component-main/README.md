### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
During the course of this project, I learnt new things such as Flexbox and CSS Grid. To be honest I didn't have any idea of how to align elements side by side with ease, this project helped me master the basics.


### Continued development
I think I would want to continue focusing on Flexbox, CSS Grid and responsive design, I'm starting to realize the importance of them, and only the basics wont help.


### Useful resources
